- **View & Edit Masking Map**: Browse masking dataset assignments, edit datasets and deterministic settings
- **Schema & Table Filtering**: Filter by schema, table name, classification type, or masking dataset
- **Search**: Quick search across table names
- **Show/Hide Filters**: Quickly view tables with/without classification or masking assignments

### Editing Features
- **Inline Editing**: Click to edit classification types or masking datasets directly in the table view
- **Change Tracking**: All modifications are tracked with visual indicators (yellow highlighting)
- **Review & Save**: Review all pending changes before saving, with old vs new value comparison
- **Discard Changes**: Option to discard all pending changes
- **Export Modified Files**: Download updated classification.json and masking.json files

### Advanced Options
- **Subset Options Builder**: Configure starting tables, excluded tables, static data tables, manual relationships, and settings for the TDM `rgsubset` command
- **Masking Options Builder**: Configure built-in rules, custom classification rules, custom datasets, table/column exclusions, and column overrides
